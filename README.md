| 1. Pecolation              | A program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. |
| 2. Deque & Randomize Queue | A generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. |
| 3. Collinear Points        | A program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points and investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. |
| 4. 8-puzzle                | solve the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm |
| 5. KdTree                  | implemented a 2d-tree to support efficient range search and nearest neighbor search |
